-   Set your bet amount on the screen.
-   Place one or two simultaneous bets, depending on your strategy.
-   Watch the plane ascend, and click **Cash Out** when you\'re
    satisfied with the multiplier.

The thrill of this game lies in deciding when to cash out---too early,
and you miss out on higher winnings; too late, and you lose your bet.
